#### Target Player Exerience

The target experience is one where the player can laugh at the absolutely ridiculous concept of the game and at the same time try and explore the world under pressure. Players are going to have to analyze clues, pay close attention to detail and do anything - and we mean anything - the jury asks for in order to win.

#### Core Diagram

1.  Core Mechaninc

    -    Walk in a top down view to find important objects in the environment

2.  Secondary Mechancis

    -   Dialogue with NPCs that may or may not provide insight on the location of evidence
    -   This evidence will be shown in an NPC interaction that happens 3 times on a time interval
    -   Items that allow you to unlock other areas (e.g. key for locked door)
    -   Items appear in an inventory for the player when picked up


3.  Progression

    -   Player has three ‘days’ to fulfill all of the juries requests - varies from evidence to other random things to convince them that the Iceberg is guilty.  The player will explore the ship, talk to NPCs and more to complete tasks within the time limit

4.  Narrative

    -   You’re a passenger on the most hyped up ship in the 1910’s - the Titanic! However, you get bad vibes from one of the other passengers. He’s a bit too mountain-shaped, cold, and icy. You don’t think much of it, until a message appears that contains a threat that the writer of the note is going to sink the ship in three days.  It has to be Iceberg, but the guests don’t believe you! To win them over, you have to convince the jury that the iceberg is guilty by completing tasks and presenting evidence that you found throughout the ship.

#### Minimal Viable Interaction

Player has to complete task for one jury member within one day. There will be NPC(s) that the player can communicate with, an inventory to keep your items and items to find with at least one room to explore. We may have the visual inventory menu setup if we get it done in time, however the inventory isn’t integral to the minimal interaction so we aren’t planning on having it set up by then.  We will only have one jury member and one day to start out, as that will give us the base for our game.

    -  Based on this real event obviously, and this is what happens when you lose.

    -  Our game will be functionally similar to one case from these games. Going around collecting evidence to show to a jury to demonstrate your case.

    -  This style of camera angle and distance so similar game play style.
